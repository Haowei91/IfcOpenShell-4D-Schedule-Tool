# IfcOpenShell-4D-Schedule-Tool
This is a tool based on IfcOpenShell which I write during my study project.
It is my first try and experience on Python and IFC. You will find in the App.py file the class task_table which i wrote.
The tool contained a simple Scheduletable which takes IfcTask from IFC File and save up your changes into a IFC File back.
You are also able to assign a IfcTask to IfcBuildingElements. 
In the App.py file you will find discription of my Python Code marked with ###---
