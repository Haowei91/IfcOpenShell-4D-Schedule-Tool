# IfcOpenShell-4D-Schedule-Tool

This is a tool based on IfcOpenShell which I wrote during my study Project.
My tool is based on the https://github.com/jakob-beetz/IfcOpenShellScriptingTutorial. 
It is my first try and experience on Python and IFC. You will find in the App.py file the class task_table which I wrote.
The tool contains a simple Scheduletable which takes IfcTask from IFC File and saves as your changes into a IFC File back.
You are also able to assign a IfcTask to IfcBuildingElements. 
In the App.py file you will find a discription of my Python Code marked with ###---.
To use this tool, download the IfcOpenShell from link above. Following the install IfcOpenShell and replace the "app.py" file.
